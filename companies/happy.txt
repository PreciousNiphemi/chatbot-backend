We are excited to announce that Dr. Sulner has recently been recognized for being one of the best veterinarians in the county. After receiving this honor, she would like to share this message with you:

I just wanted to say a huge "Thank You!" to all of my clients, friends, and family. We were voted "One Of The Best" by the consumers who put us in the top three rated Veterinary Hospitals in all of Somerset County, NJ. This is such a fantastic honor, especially since we just opened up in January 2018. I would first like to thank all my wonderful employees ~ Dana, Kasey, Christine and Ashley and second my husband, Robert for his business savvy and IT skills. If it was not for them and their top notch customer service and support, we would not have received this award. I honestly have such a fantastic team.

Thank you again from the bottom of my heart. We would not be here if it were not for you." ~ Dr. Beth Sulner.
